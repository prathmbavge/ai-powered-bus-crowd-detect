## Setup Guide

### 1. Python AI Service
- Install Python 3.8+
- Create and activate a virtual environment
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Download YOLOv8 model (`yolov8n.pt`) and place in `python-service/`

### 2. Backend
- Install Node.js 14+
- Run `npm install` in `server/`
- Create `.env` file (see below)

### 3. Frontend
- Run `npm install` in `client/`
- Create `.env` file (see below)

---

## How to Run

1. **Start Python Service**
   - Activate venv, run: `python app.py`
2. **Start Backend**
   - Run: `npm start` in `server/`
3. **Start Frontend**
   - Run: `npm start` in `client/`

## Main Pages & UI
- **Dashboard**: See all buses, occupancy, and quick actions
- **Real-Time Monitor**: Live video, crowd analytics, charts
- **Bus Management**: Add/edit/delete buses
- **Public Bus View**: Passenger-friendly bus info
- **Video Uploader**: Upload and process videos
- **Login/Register**: Modern authentication with gradients and glassmorphism
- **Layout**: Sidebar navigation, animated transitions

### UI Highlights

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Register
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login
- `GET /api/auth/user` - Get current user

### Bus Management
- `GET /api/buses` - List buses
- `GET /api/buses/:id` - Bus details
- `POST /api/buses` - Add bus
- `PUT /api/buses/:id` - Edit bus
- `DELETE /api/buses/:id` - Delete bus

### Crowd Detection
- `POST /api/detection/start/:busId` - Start monitoring
- `POST /api/detection/stop/:busId` - Stop monitoring
- `POST /api/detection/process/:busId` - Process frame

### Python Service
- `POST /detect` - Detect people in image
- `GET /health` - Health check

## WebSocket Events
- `detection:update` - Crowd detection updates
- `monitoring:started` - Monitoring started
- `monitoring:stopped` - Monitoring stopped

---

## Troubleshooting
- If you see errors, clear cache and restart servers
- Make sure `.env` files are set up in both `client/` and `server/`
- Python service must be running before backend
- MongoDB should be running locally or update `MONGO_URI` in `.env`
